Model is working (at least superficially). Attached .png shows Karma benchmark vs. solute trapping
It would be good if in the beginning of the run, the program would print out the values of certain derived model parameters (dont know how to do this):
*Physical interface width parameter: W_physical
*Solute trapping parameter: A_trapping
*Kinetic time scale: tau0
*Dimensionless diffusion coefficient (time step size needs to be adjusted based on this): D
